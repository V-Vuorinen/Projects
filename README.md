# Welcome to My Projects (yet)!

Outside of these projects I have experience in data analysis, building basic dashboards (PowerBI) and designing data pipelines etc. Enough about that, here are projects I have developed in my portfolio, which showcases for example: web scraping, data cleaning, data analysis, reading in/into different file formats and connecting into databases. 


# Projects

## FastestListProject (most recent)

I started the project with a vision of combining a list comparing results of top speeds from different categories. The project started by scraping somewhat comparable statistics of different sources into their own lists, which had been cleaned on a basic level **(folder: WebScraping files: fastest_animals.ipynb, fastest_cars.ipynb, fastest_tennis_serve.ipynb)** and written in their own files all in different formats **(folder: WebScraping files: Fastest_Animals.csv, Fastest_Cars.json, Fastest_Tennis_serves.xml)**. After writing the data frames into earlier mentioned files they were exported into a PostgreSQL database.

As a conclusion I queried the files from the PostgreSQL database into their own data frames, which was then cleaned, merged and written into a csv file **(folder: FinalList+Analysis files: fastest_list.ipynb, Fastest_List.csv)**. I performed some analysis with different methods on the list and downloaded it as a html file**(folder: FinalList+Analysis files: fastest_analysis.ipynb, fastest_analysis.html)**.

**I am still working on the dashboard**, which will be done with Tableau. 

## CoffeeShopSales

In this project the data was as a ready csv dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset consists of purchase history records from a small coffee shop chain with three locations. I tried to understand the trends of each individual location within opening hours. The analysis includes different plots to help showcase differences between the locations. 

## ML_on_Kaggle (competition)

I enjoy machine learning and this project is my submission to a ongoing competition in Kaggle. The project showcases the usage of machine learning and predicting possible outcomes of victims in the Titanic incident.

## Autokanta

This is a older project with basic analysis of a dataset consisting of the whole record of vehicles registered in Finland. The project is ongoing and would have plenty of work still to be made. The project showcases operating a encoded csv file and managing a big dataset.
