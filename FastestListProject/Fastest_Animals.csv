0,1,Peregrine falcon,Flight-diving,"The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of theanimal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speed of over 320 km/h (200 mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58 cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170 m/s (560 ft/s).",389 km/h
1,2,Golden eagle,Flight-diving,"Assuming the maximum size at 1.02 m, its relative speed clocks at 66–87 body lengths per second, the equivalent of a human running at 60–80 m/s (197–262 ft/s).",240–320 km/h
